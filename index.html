                    <p>
                        <strong>WHAT?</strong> <br><br>
                        Are you curious how people build Apps for "smart" phones? <br><br>
                        In our 3-day App Camp you will learn how to turn your ideas into Apps for Android phones! <br><br>
                        We love to build Apps that connect people, help us better understand our world and each other, let us have fun together or help us with our daily lives. For example, what is the arabic word for "school holidays" and what activities do young people in other countries like to do? Maybe you want to build an App that shows all the sport places in your area, or a Quiz App to learn german - or something completely different! We will have a lot of fun learning together and at the end of the workshop we will all present the Apps we have built. 
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    <strong>WHY?</strong><br><br>

                    We want to show you that building Apps is not so hard and that it is a lot of fun! We want to show you that anyone can learn programming and we want you to know how things work so you can use programming to bring your ideas into the world.

                <p>
                        <strong>WHO IS IT FOR?</strong> <br><br>

                        For teenagers 13 years and older. If you haven't programmed before or you are not sure what programming is, that's fine! You will learn all about it in our workshop. The only thing you need is curiosity and motivation!<br><br> We look forward to seeing you in our workshop!
